            		<p>Collections are fundamental to many programming tasks: they let you group and process data. To illustrate collections in action, imagine you want to create a collection of dishes to represent a menu and then iterate through it to sum the calories of each dish.</p>
					</br>
						<p>So first, what exactly is a stream? A short definition is &ldquo;a sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s break down this definition step by step:</p>
						</br>
						<p> Sequence of elements&mdash; Like a collection, a stream provides an interface to a sequenced set of values of a specific element type. Because collections are data structures, they&rsquo;re mostly about storing and accessing elements with specific time/space complexities (for example, an ArrayList vs. a LinkedList). But streams are about expressing computations such as filter, sorted, and map that you saw earlier. Collections are about data; streams are about computations. We explain this idea in greater detail in the coming sections.</p>
						<p> Source&mdash; Streams consume from a data-providing source such as collections, arrays, or I/O resources. Note that generating a stream from an ordered collection preserves the ordering. The elements of a stream coming from a list will have the same order as the list.</p>
						<p> Data processing operations&mdash; Streams support database-like operations and common operations from functional programming languages to manipulate data, such as filter, map, reduce, find, match, sort, and so on. Stream operations can be executed either sequentially or in parallel.</p>
						<p> Pipelining&mdash; Many stream operations return a stream themselves, allowing operations to be chained and form a larger pipeline. This enables certain optimizations that we explain in the next chapter, such as laziness and short-circuiting. A pipeline of operations can be viewed as a database-like query on the data source.</p>
						<p> Internal iteration&mdash; In contrast to collections, which are iterated explicitly using an iterator, stream operations do the iteration behind the scenes for you. We briefly mentioned this idea in chapter 1 and return to it later in the next section.</p>
