              		<p>A functional interface specifies exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces are useful because the signature of the abstract method can describe the signature of a lambda expression. The signature of the abstract method of a functional interface is called a function descriptor.</p>
              		<p>So in order to use different lambda expressions, you need a set of functional interfaces that can describe common function descriptors. There are several functional interfaces already available in the Java API such as Comparable, Runnable, and Callable.</p>

              		</br>
                  		<p>The java.util.function.Predicate&lt;T&gt; interface defines an abstract method named test that accepts an object of generic type T and returns a boolean. It&rsquo;s exactly the same one that you created earlier, but is available out of the box! You might want to use this interface when you need to represent a boolean expression that uses an object of type T.</p>
