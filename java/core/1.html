						</div>
						<div class="market-status-table mt-4">
							<p>Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by what is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In essence, the original JVM was designed as an interpreter for bytecode.&nbsp;</p>
							</br>
							<p>Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run a program in a wide variety of environments because only the JVM needs to be implemented for each platform. Once a JRE exists for a given system, any Java program can run on it.</p>
							</br>
							<p>Remember, although the details of the JVM will differ from platform to platform, all understand the same Java bytecode. If a Java program were compiled to native code, then different versions of the same program would have to exist for each type of CPU connected to the Internet.</p>
							</br>
							<p>The fact that a Java program is executed by the JVM also helps to make it secure. Because the JVM is in control, it manages program execution. Thus, it is possible for the JVM to create a restricted execution environment, called the sandbox, that contains the program, preventing unrestricted access to the machine. Safety is also enhanced by certain restrictions that exist in the Java language.</p>
							</br>
							<p>Although Java was designed as an interpreted language, there is nothing about Java that prevents on-the-fly compilation of bytecode into native code in order to boost performance. For this reason, the HotSpot technology was introduced not long after Java&rsquo;s initial release. HotSpot provides a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for bytecode.</p>
							</br>
							<p>When a JIT compiler is part of the JVM, selected portions of bytecode are compiled into executable code in real time, on a piece-by-piece, demand basis. It is important to understand that an entire Java program is not compiled into executable code all at once. Instead, a JIT compiler compiles code as it is needed, during execution.</p>
							</br>
							<p>Furthermore, not all sequences of bytecode are compiled&mdash;only those that will benefit from compilation. The remaining code is simply interpreted. However, the just-in- time approach still yields a significant performance boost. Even when dynamic compilation is applied to bytecode, the portability and safety features still apply, because the JVM is still in charge of the execution environment.</p>
							</br>
							<p>One other point: Beginning with JDK 9, some Java environments will also support an ahead-of-time compiler that can be used to compile bytecode into native code prior to execution by the JVM, rather than on-the-fly. Ahead-of- time compilation is a specialized feature, and it does not replace Java&rsquo;s traditional approach just described.</p>
