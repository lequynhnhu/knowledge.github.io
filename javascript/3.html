					<p>Using HTTP/2 only through HTTPS means that it&rsquo;s less likely there will be compatibility issues. Many HTTP-aware pieces of infrastructure on the internet wouldn&rsquo;t know how to handle HTTP/2 messages until they&rsquo;re upgraded. By wrapping the messages in HTTPS, you hide the HTTP messages themselves and therefore prevent compatibility issues.</p>
					</br>
					<p>The second reason is more ideological in nature. Many browser vendors (and others, including me) strongly believe in moving away from unencrypted HTTP and further believe that all websites should move to HTTPS. Therefore, newer features are often restricted to HTTPS as a form of encouraging that move.</p>
					</br>
					<p>HTTPS adds security, privacy, and integrity to communications with websites. These features are no longer important only for e-commerce sites, where payment details need to be protected, but should be important for all sites.Search terms and the pages you&rsquo;re looking at contain personal data that could be sensitive.</p>
					</br>
					<p>A sign-up form asking for your email address to register interest is collecting private information, so it should be secured. Although intercepting and altering data may sound unlikely for a blog, for example, data providers such as mobile operators and airplane Wi-Fi operators regularly inject advertisements if users are browsing the internet through them and HTTPS isn&rsquo;t used on the site to prevent this situation. More malicious parties can inject more dangerous content, such as crypto-currency mining JavaScript code or malware.</p>
					</br>
					<p>To be able to use HTTP/2, both the browser and the server must support HTTP/2. If users use a proxy that effectively breaks the HTTP connection in two, however, that might prevent the use of HTTP/2 if the proxy doesn&rsquo;t support HTTP/2.</p>
					</br>
					<p>In many corporate environments, it&rsquo;s common to use a proxy and restrict direct internet access. This allows scanning for threats, and prevents access to certain sites (such as personal email accounts). Similarly, for the home user, many antivirus products create a proxy through which web traffic flows for scanning purposes.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>For HTTPS traffic (as required by HTTP/2 for all web browsers), this situation is a problem, as these proxies can&rsquo;t read this encrypted traffic. Therefore, when you use a proxy that needs to read HTTPS traffic, your browser is configured to create one HTTPS connection to the proxy, and the proxy creates a separate HTTPS connection to the real website. So your web browser is making an HTTPS connection only to the proxy and sends a fake HTTPS certificate to the browser, pretending to be the real site.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Normally, this condition would be a big warning sign in browsers, as part of the point of HTTPS is to validate the authenticity of the HTTPS certificate issuer. Installing these proxies, however, involves setting up the proxy software as a recognized certificate issuer on that computer, so the web browser will accept these fake certificates.</p>
					</br>
					<p>Splitting the traffic into two parts allows the proxy to read the traffic, but, unfortunately, your browser is no longer connecting directly to the website, so your ability to use HTTP/2 depends on whether the proxy supports HTTP/2. If the proxy doesn&rsquo;t support HTTP/2, it effectively downgrades your connection to HTTP/1.1. In addition to not benefiting from HTTP/2, you may be confused about why the downgrade is happening when both browser and server seem to support HTTP/2.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Many people in the security industry think that intercepting proxies cause more problems than they solve, because browser makers generally are strong and proactive about ensuring good HTTPS connections, and breaking this connection in two means that the browser can no longer verify the final connection. Regardless, proxies are being used and need to be considered in trying to understand HTTP/2 support.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>On the positive side, intercepting proxies usually are used in home or corporate environments where the connection is typically fast anyway and HTTP/2 is less beneficial. It&rsquo;s much rarer to intercept mobile traffic this way, and low-latency networks (such as mobile) are some of the primary beneficiaries of improvements in HTTP/2.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h4>SUMMARY OF BROWSER SUPPORT OF HTTP/2</h4>
						</br>
						<p>Browser support for HTTP/2 is generally strong, and the advent of evergreen browsers that automatically update has meant that the rollout of HTTP/2 happened pretty seamlessly on the browser side. There are several reasons why HTTP/2 may not be used, however, including the need for strong HTTPS setup on the server side and the use of intercepting proxies.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The requirement for HTTPS, and especially the strict nature of the type of HTTPS, is an added complication in enabling HTTP/2 and does cause confusion. This complication mostly requires the server to be set up correctly, however. The web is moving toward HTTPS, and the penalties for unencrypted HTTP sites will continue to grow, with more visible warnings and fewer features available.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>At this writing, more than 75% of internet traffic is served over HTTPS. Although that figure is undoubtedly skewed by high use of several large sites, the reality is that if you run a website that doesn&rsquo;t use HTTPS, you should be making plans to move to it as soon as possible.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h4>Evergreen browsers</h4>
						</br>
						<p>Browsers such as Chrome and Firefox update silently in the background without prompting the user and are known as evergreen browsers. As a result, users of these browsers are likely to be running the latest versions of these browsers, which have HTTP/2 support.</p>
