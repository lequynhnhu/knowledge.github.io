				</div>
				<div class="market-status-table mt-4">
					<br/>
					<p>In general, a type system assigns a type to each variable, expression, object, function, class, or module in the system. These types are used alongside a set of rules designed to expose errors in the program. These checks can be performed at compile time (static checking) or at runtime (dynamic checking). Typical rules would include ensuring that the value used in an assignment is the same type as the variable it is being assigned to, or ensuring that a function call supplies arguments of the correct type based on the function signature.</p>
					<br/>
					<h5>Optional Static Types</h5>
						<p>JavaScript is dynamically typed; variables do not have a fixed type, so no type restrictions can be applied to operations. You can assign a value of one type to a variable and later assign a value of a completely different type to the same variable. You can perform an operation with two incompatible values and get unpredictable results. If you call a function, there is nothing to enforce that you pass arguments of the correct type and you can even supply too many or too few arguments.</p>
						<p>TypeScript provides a system for inferring and specifying types, but allows types to be optional. The optionality is important because it means you can choose when to enforce types and when to allow dynamic types. Unless you opt out of type checking, using the any type, the compiler will attempt to determine the types in your program and will check inferred types as well as the explicit types you specify using type annotations.</p>
						<p>All the checks are performed at compile time, which is what makes TypeScript statically typed. The compiler is responsible for constructing a schedule of all the types, checking expressions against these types and removing all the type information when it converts the code into valid JavaScript.</p>
					<br/>
					<h5>Structural Typing</h5>
						<p>TypeScript has a structural type system; this contrasts with most C-like languages, which are typically nominative. A nominative, or nominal, type system relies on explicitly named annotations to determine types. In a nominal system, a class would only be seen to implement an interface if it was decorated with the name of the interface (i.e., it must explicitly state that it implements the interface). In a structural type system, the explicit decoration is not required and a value is acceptable as long as its structure matches the specification of the required type.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>A nominal type system is intended to prevent accidental type equivalence &mdash; just because something has the same properties does not mean it is valid &mdash; but as TypeScript is structurally typed accidental type equivalence is possible, and desirable.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>property with an equivalent type would be acceptable. If you wanted to use custom types for this kind of type safety in TypeScript, you would have to ensure the types were not accidentally equivalent by making them structurally unique. It is possible to do this using private members on a class to make it structurally unmatchable,</p>
						<br/>
						<p>While structural typing may seem to cause difficulties in a limited number of specialized situations, it has many advantages. For example, it is far easier to introduce compatible types without having to change existing code, and it is possible to create types that can be passed to external code without inheriting from an external class. It also outperforms nominal types in its ability to introduce a new supertype without changing the newly demoted subtypes, or the code that interacts with them.</p>
						<p>One of the most significant benefits of structural typing is it saves myriad explicit type name decorations. It is possible to implement an interface without adding a specific type annotation, and anonymous objects can be created to match interfaces and classes without the need to add type annotations. You can use these objects if the properties and methods are of the same type, or compatible types, as the required type. A compatible type can be a subtype, a narrower type, or a structurally similar type.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>One thing to avoid in a structurally typed language, such as TypeScript, is empty structures. An empty interface or an empty class is essentially a valid supertype of practically everything in your program, which means any object could be substituted for the empty structure at compile time because there is no contract to satisfy during type checking.</p>
						<p>Structural typing complements the type inference in TypeScript. With these features, you can leave much of the work to the compiler and language service, rather than having to explicitly add type information and class heritage throughout your program.</p>
						<br/>
					<h5>Optional Static Types</h5>
						<br/>
						<p>When you compile your TypeScript program into plain JavaScript, the generated code is different in two ways: code transformation and type erasure. The code transformation converts language features that are not available in the target JavaScript version into representations that are valid.</p>
						<p>For example, if you are targeting ECMAScript 5, where classes are not available, all your classes will be converted into immediately invoked function expressions that create appropriate representations using the prototypal inheritance available in ECMAScript 5. Type erasure is</p>
						<p>Type erasure removes type annotations, custom types, and interfaces. These are only required at design time and at compile time for the purpose of static checking. At runtime types are not checked so the type information is not needed. You shouldn&rsquo;t encounter a problem at runtime because the logical use of types has been checked, except where you have opted out by using the "any" type.</p>
						<br/>
					<h5>Ambient Declarations</h5>
						<br/>
						<p>Ambient declarations can be used to add type information to existing JavaScript code. Commonly, this is used to add type information for your own existing code, or for a third-party library that you want to consume in your TypeScript program.</p>
						<p>Ambient declarations can be gradually constructed by starting with a simple imprecise declaration and turning up the dial on the details over time.&nbsp;</p>
						<br/>
						<p>declare var $: any;<br />$('#id').html('Hello World');</p>
						<br/>
						<p> => shows an example of the least precise ambient<br />declaration you can write for the jQuery framework. The declaration simply notifies the compiler that an external variable will exist at runtime without supplying further details of the structure of the external variable. This will suppress errors for the $ variable, but will not supply deep type checking or useful autocompletion.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>All ambient declarations begin with the declare keyword. This tells the compiler that the following code block contains only type information and no implementation. Blocks of code created using the declare keyword will be erased during compilation and result in no JavaScript output. At runtime, you are responsible for ensuring the code exists and that it matches your declaration.</p>
						<p>To get the full benefit of compile-time checking, you can create a more detailed ambient declaration that covers more of the features of the external JavaScript that you use. If you are building an ambient declaration, you can choose to cover the features you use the most, or the higher-risk features that you judge to be the most likely source of type errors. This allows you to invest in defining the type information that gives you the most return on your time investment.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>It is possible to create ambient declarations for variables, functions, classes, enumerations, and both internal and external modules. Interfaces appear to be missing from this list, but interfaces are already analogous to ambient declarations as they describe a type without resulting in any compiled code. This means you can write ambient declarations using interfaces, but you would not use the declare keyword for interfaces.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="market-status-table mt-4">
							<br/>
							<p>Type inference is the polar opposite of type erasure. Type inference is the process by which types are determined at compile time in the absence of explicit type annotations.</p>
							<p>TypeScript performs deep inspections to create a schedule of types in your program and compares assignments, expressions, and operations using this schedule of types. During this process, there are some clever tricks that are employed when a direct type is not available, which allow the type to be found indirectly. One such trick is contextual typing, where TypeScript uses the context of an expression to determine the types.</p>
							<br/>
							<h6>a. Best Common Type</h6>
								<br/>
									<p>When type information is being inferred, there are a limited number of situations where the best common type must be determined.</p>
									<p>The process of determining the best common type is not just used for array literal expressions; they also are used to determine any case where multiple values have different types, such as the return type of a function or method that contains multiple return statements.</p>
									<br/>
									<p>// number[]<br />let x = [0, 1, null];</p>
									<p><br />// (string | number)[]<br />let y = [0, 1, null, 'a'];</p>
								<br/>
							<h6>b. Contextual Types</h6>
								<br/>
								<p>Contextual types are a good example of how advanced type inference can be. Contextual typing occurs when the compiler bases its types on the location of an expression.</p>
								<p>window.onclick = function(event) {<br />var button = event.button;<br />};</p>
								<br/>
							<h6>c. Widened Types</h6>
								<br/>
								<p>The term &ldquo;widened type&rdquo; refers to situations in TypeScript where the type of a function call, expression, or assignment is null or undefined.</p>
								<p>function example() {<br />return null;<br />}<br />var widened = example ();</p>
								<br/>
							<h6>When to Annotate</h6>
								<br/>
								<p>Because type inference has been a key feature of TypeScript since day one, the discussion on when to make types explicit with type annotations can take place without controversy. This has been a tricky topic for statically typed languages that have later decided to add some level of support for type inference.</p>
								<p>The final decision about the level of type annotations you add to your program should be made jointly between all team members, but you may wish to use the following suggestions as a starting point for your discussion.</p>
									<p>&bull; Start by adding no type annotations (full inference.)</p>
									<p>&bull; Add type annotations where the inferred type would be any.</p>
									<p>&bull; Add type annotations for public method return types.</p>
									<p>&bull; Add type annotations for public method parameters.</p>
								<br/>
						<h5>Duplicate Identifiers</h5>
							<br/>
								<p>Overall, you should do your best to avoid name clashes in your program. TypeScript supplies the tools to make name clashes unnecessary by allowing you to move your program out of the global scope and into modules. However, there are some interesting features around identifiers in TypeScript, including many situations where you are permitted to use the same name within the same scope.</p>
								<p>In most cases, the use of an existing class or variable name within the same scope will result in a &ldquo;Duplicate identifier&rdquo; error. No particular structure gets preferential treatment; the latter of the two identifiers will be the source of the error. If you re-use a namespace multiple times in your program, this will not result in a duplicate identifier error because all of the individual blocks are logically merged into a single namespace.</p>
								<p>Another valid use of a duplicate identifier is with interfaces. Once again, the compiler knows that there will be no duplicate identifier at runtime because interfaces are erased during compilation; its identifier will never appear in the JavaScript output. The use of a duplicate identifier for an interface and a variable is a common pattern in the TypeScript library, where the standard types are defined using an interface and then allocated to a variable declaration with a type annotation.</p>
							<br/>
						<h5>Type Checking</h5>
							<br/>
							<p>Once a schedule of types has been gathered from your program, the TypeScript compiler is able to use this schedule to perform type checking. At its simplest, the compiler is checking that when a function is called that accepts a parameter of type "number"; all calling code passes an argument with a type that is compatible with the "number" type.</p>
							<p>Type checking is not limited to positive matching, where the supplied type must have the structure of the required type. An increasing number of negative checks are being added to the compiler that enables it to detect a different class of error.</p>
							<p>For example, the excess property warning will highlight properties that are not anticipated on an object, which is a great way to catch situations where you have mis-typed a property name. This kind of checking may introduce additional errors as you upgrade the version of TypeScript you use in your projects, but if you persevere and review the messages the compiler is sending you, you will eventually find subtle bugs that the compiler has managed to catch for you.</p>

					<h5>1. Open Recursion</h5>
						<br/>
						<p>Open recursion is a combination of recursion and late binding. When a method calls itself within a class, that call can be forwarded to a replacement defined in a subclass.</p>
						<p>Open recursion is a programming technique where a method or function can call another method or function of the same object (or a related object) through a special reference (typically this or self). In TypeScript, this concept is particularly relevant when working with classes and objects.</p>
						<br/>
					<h5>2. Delegation</h5>
						<br/>
						<p>One of the most important concepts in terms of re-use in your program is delegation. Delegation describes the situation where one part of your program hands over a task to another part. In true delegation, the wrapper passes a reference to itself into the delegate, which allows the delegate to call back into the original wrapper, for example, the wrapper class would call the delegate class, passing the keyword this into the delegate, allowing the delegate to call public methods on the wrapper class. This allows the wrapper class and delegate class to behave as a subclass and superclass.</p>
						<p>Where the wrapper doesn&rsquo;t pass a reference to itself, the operation is technically known as forwarding rather than delegation. In both delegation and forwarding you may call a method on one class, but that class hands off the processing to another class,</p>

							<br/>
							<p>Even an aged browser will give you access to the Document Object Model (DOM), mouse and keyboard events, forms, and navigation. A modern browser will add offline storage, an indexed database, HTTP requests, geolocation, and suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) for device sensors such as light, accelerometer, and proximity.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>As well as processing the queue containing all the events, the runtime may have other tasks to perform that need to be processed on the same thread; for example, a browser may need to redraw the screen. If you have a function that takes too long to run, you could affect the redraw speed of the browser. To allow a browser to draw 60 frames per second, you would need to keep the execution of any function to less than 17 ms. Keeping functions fast is very easy in practice, except where you deal with an API with blocking calls, such as localStorage, or if you execute a long-running loop.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>One of the most common side effects of the single-threaded approach at runtime is that intervals and timers may appear to take longer than the specified time to execute. This is because they must wait in the queue to be executed.</p>
							<br/>
							<h5>1. Scope</h5>
								<br/>
								<p>The term scope refers to the set of available identifiers that can be resolved in a given context. In most C-like languages, identifiers are block scoped, meaning they are available within the same set of curly braces that they are defined in. Variables declared within a set of curly braces are not available outside of those braces, but statements within the curly braces can access variables declared outside of the braces.</p>
								<p>Both let and const are block scoped and will save you from the many pitfalls of function-scoped variables. The const keyword has the additional advantage of preventing reassignment, which means the variable cannot be overwritten (although its value can change).</p>
								<p>Variable hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript (and by extension, TypeScript) where variable declarations are moved ("hoisted") to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.</p>
								<br/>
								<h6>a. Callbacks</h6>
									<br/>
									<p>A callback is simply a function that you pass as an argument, and which is called when an operation has completed.</p>
									<p>Because the request is blocking the main thread for the duration of the request, no other statements can be executed. Blocking the event queue for more than a few milliseconds is undesirable and must be avoided for long operations. Operations involving calls to the file system, hardware devices, or calls across a network connection all have the potential to block your program for unacceptable lengths of time.</p>
									<br/>
									<p>Callbacks are very useful for avoiding these blocking requests. When the request is made, a function is passed along with the request. The main thread is then able to process the event queue as normal. When the long-running process ends, the callback function is then called, being passed any relevant arguments. This adds the callback to the event queue, where it is executed in turn.</p>
									<br/>
								<h6>b. Passing Functions as Arguments</h6>
									<br/>
									<p>Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript, which means they can be passed as arguments, returned from another function as a return value, assigned to variables, and stored as properties on an object. Passing a function as an argument is the mechanism used to provide callbacks.</p>
									<p>You can use the ability to pass functions as arguments to create a simple implementation of the observer pattern, storing a collection of subscribers and publishing an event to them all from a single class.</p>
									<br/>
								<h6>c. Promises</h6>
								<br/>
									<p>Promises were introduced to reduce several problems caused by callbacks. When using a chain of callbacks, code can become deeply nested and difficult to follow. When error handling is considered, the callbacks often repeat error handling code, further increasing the cognitive overhead of understanding the program.</p>
									<p>One of the problems associated with the callback pattern is that it isn&rsquo;t possible to handle any exceptions that occur within the asynchronous code. No matter where you insert a try/catch statement, you won&rsquo;t be able to handle the error in this version of the API.</p>
									<p>To solve the problem of error handling, we will introduce an additional parameter to the callback function. This is a common pattern in programs that use callbacks extensively. By placing the error parameter first, the success condition can have a variable number of parameters without affecting where the calling code should expect to find information about a problem.</p>
									<br/>
									<p>An alternative to chaining multiple promises is to aggregate their results with a wrapper promise that is responsible for obtaining the values from the individual sub-promises. There is a mechanism built into promises that allows this to be done with a simple call to "Promise.all".</p>
									<p>Once all promises have been settled the then block is executed with the results. If there are any errors, the catch block is called immediately; this is a fail-fast mechanism.</p>
								<h6>d. Fastest Promise</h6>
									<br/>
									<p>If you are calling several asynchronous operations and are only interested in getting the fastest result, you can use the Promise.race method.</p>
									<p>Promises offer a superior mechanism for handling asynchronous chains, reducing nesting, and both simplifying and standardizing error handling. There are also some useful standard compositions of promises that allow you to fire off many asynchronous operations and converge on a single then block when the promises are all fulfilled.</p
									<br/>
							<h5>2. Events</h5>
								<br/>
								<p>Events are a fundamental concept in the JavaScript runtime. Event listeners are commonly attached to user-initiated events such as touch, click, keypress, and other interactions on a web page, but events can also be used as a mechanism for decoupling code that needs to trigger processing and the code that undertakes the work.</p>
								<p>Events are handled across two distinct phases &mdash; capturing and bubbling.</p>
								<br/>
								<ol>
 								 	<li>During capturing, the event is sent to the topmost elements in the document hierarchy first and then to more deeply nested elements.</li>
  									<li>2. During bubbling, it is sent to the target element first and then to its ancestors.</li>
								</ol>
								<br/>
								<p>At the risk of overstating the point about running in an event loop on a single thread, it is worth remembering that multiple event listeners attached to the same event will execute sequentially, not in parallel, and a long-running listener may delay the execution of the subsequent listeners attached to the same event. When an event is triggered, each event listener is queued in the same order it is attached; if the first listener takes 2 s to run, the second listener is blocked for at least 2 s and will only execute once it reaches the top of the event queue.</p>
								<br/>
								<h6>a. TypeScript’s Custom-Event Mechanism</h6>
									<p><p>In some environments, it is as simple as using<br />addEventListener and dispatchEvent. You can pass custom data as part of the event to use in the listener.</p></p>
									<br/>
								<h6>b. Event Phases</h6>
									<br/>
									<p>An event is dispatched to an event target along a propagation path that flows from the root of the document to the target element. Each progression along the path from the root to the target element is part of the capture phase of the event and the phase will be 1. Then the event reaches the event target, and the phase changes to the target phase, which is phase 2. Finally, the event flows in the reverse direction from the event target back to the root in the bubbling phase, which is phase 3.</p>
									<br/>
								<h6>c. Extending Objects</h6>
								<br/>
									<p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object that consists of a set of properties. Each property is a key-value pair with a string key and value of any type, including primitive types, objects, and functions. If the value is a function, it is commonly called a method. Whenever you create a class in TypeScript, it is represented using JavaScript objects, but there are also many built-in objects that you can use.</p>
									<p>The native objects all remain open, which means you can extend them as easily as you can your own objects. You need to take care when extending a native object for the following reasons:</p>
										<br/>
										<p>&bull; If everyone extended native objects, the chances are the extensions would overwrite each other or combine in incompatible ways.</p>
										<p>&bull; It is possible that the native object definition may later clash with yours, and your implementation will hide the native implementation.</p>
										<br/>
									<p>So, although it is possible to extend native objects, in general it is only recommended as a technique to be used as a polyfill, which is a way of adding current features to older runtimes. Although you may decide to live by a less restrictive rule, it is worth writing extensions to native objects in the style of a polyfill so you can at least detect when one of the following happens:</p>
										<br/>
										<p>&bull; Native functionality is added with a name that clashes with your extension.</p>
										<p>&bull; Another programmer adds another extension with the same name.</p>
										<p>&bull; A third-party library or framework adds an extension with the same name.</p>
										<br/>
									<p><strong>Extending the Prototype:</strong> Extending objects via the prototype is a technique that can be used on any object in TypeScript, even your own, unless it is sealed. Extending prototypes is a convoluted way to add behavior to objects that are under your control.</p>
									<p><strong>Sealing Objects: </strong> If you are concerned about your code being extended, you can prevent extensions being made to your instances by using Object.seal.</p>
										<br/>
										<p>You can check whether an object is sealed using the Object.isSealed method, passing in the object you want to check.</p>
										<p>&bull; Object.preventExtensions/Object.isExtensible is a more permissive version of Object.seal, allowing the properties to be deleted and to be added to the prototype.</p>
										<p>&bull; Object.freeze/Object.isFrozen is a more restrictive alternative to Object.seal that prevents properties from being added or removed and also prevents values being changed.</p>
									<p><strong>Alternatives to Extending</strong> It would be somewhat irresponsible to advise against extending native objects without presenting an alternative solution to the problem. This section shows an example of the classList property that is available on HTML elements in modern web browsers.</p>
