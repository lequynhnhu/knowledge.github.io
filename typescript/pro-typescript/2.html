					<br/>
					<p>In general, a type system assigns a type to each variable, expression, object, function, class, or module in the system. These types are used alongside a set of rules designed to expose errors in the program. These checks can be performed at compile time (static checking) or at runtime (dynamic checking). Typical rules would include ensuring that the value used in an assignment is the same type as the variable it is being assigned to, or ensuring that a function call supplies arguments of the correct type based on the function signature.</p>
					<h6>Optional Static Types</h6>
						<p>JavaScript is dynamically typed; variables do not have a fixed type, so no type restrictions can be applied to operations. You can assign a value of one type to a variable and later assign a value of a completely different type to the same variable. You can perform an operation with two incompatible values and get unpredictable results. If you call a function, there is nothing to enforce that you pass arguments of the correct type and you can even supply too many or too few arguments.</p>
