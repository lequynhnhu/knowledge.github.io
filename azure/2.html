          				<p>Authentication technologies are used to control who can access a system. When a process or user tries to access a system, the authentication scheme identifies if the requesting process or user is known. When a user or process is allowed access, they're referred to as authenticated. Authentication helps to protect unwanted access to a system by allowing access only to users or processes that are authenticated.</p>
          				</br>
          				<p>Authorization mechanisms provide a more granular level of access control by guarding access to specific resources. When an authenticated process or user tries to access a particular resource, the authorization scheme verifies if the user or process has permission to access the requested resource. Authorization also considers the type of access requested, such as read-only, write, or administrate.</p>

						<h4>Design for identity and access management (IAM)</h4>
						</br>
							<p>To implement authentication and authorization, Azure Architects design identity and access management (IAM) solutions. These solutions must work for all users, applications, and devices. A strong IAM solution should have unified identity management, secure adaptive access, simplified identity governance, and a seamless user experience.</p>
							<p>The characteristics of a strong IAM solution:</p>
							<p><strong>Unified identity management</strong>. Manage all your identities and access to all your applications in a central location, whether they&rsquo;re in the cloud or on-premises, to improve visibility and control.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Seamless user experience.</strong> Provide an easy, fast sign-in experience to keep your users productive, reduce time spent managing passwords, and increase end-user productivity.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Secure adaptive access.</strong> Protect access to resources and data by using strong authentication and risk-based adaptive access policies without compromising the user experience.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Simplified identity governance.</strong> Control access to applications and data for all users and admins. Automated identity governance ensures only authorized users have access.</p>
