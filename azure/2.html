						</br>
							<p>When you need to create an App Service resource, such as a web app, you create or use an existing service plan. The service plan defines the amount of resources availableto you, how much automation is available to scale and back up your web app, and how highly available to make your site with staging slots and Traffic Manager</p>
							</br>
							<p> <strong>Free/Shared</strong>&mdash;Uses a shared infrastructure; offers minimal storage, and has no options for deploying different staged versions, routing of traffic, or backups. The Shared tier allows you to use a custom domain and charges for this domain.</p>
							</br>
							<p> <strong>Basic</strong>&mdash;Provides dedicated compute resources for your web app, and allows you to use SSL and manually scale the number of web app instances you run. The free/shared and basic tiers provide a good environment for you to test the Web Apps service, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend running any actual production or development workloads. The performance isn&rsquo;t a limiting factor, but you miss some of the automated features, such as backups and scaling.</p>
							</br>
							<p> <strong>Standard</strong>&mdash;Adds daily backups, automatic scale of web app instances, and deployment slots, and allows you to route users with Traffic Manager. This tier may be suitable for low-demand applications or development environments in which you don&rsquo;t need a large number of backups or deployment slots.</p>
							</br>
							<p> <strong>Premium</strong>&mdash;Provides more frequent backups, increased storage, and a greater number of deployment slots and instance scaling options. This tier is ideal for most production workloads.</p>
