          				<p> On-premises &mdash;You configure and manage the entire data center, such as the network cables, storage, and servers. You&rsquo;re responsible for all parts of the application environment, support, and redundancy. This approach provides maximum control, but with a lot of management overhead.</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) &mdash;You purchase the base compute resources from a vendor that manages the core infrastructure. You create and manage the VMs, data, and applications. The cloud provider is responsible for the physical infrastructure, host management, and resiliency. You may still have an infrastructure team to help support and deploy VMs, but the team is free from the time and cost of managing the physical equipment.</p>
						<p>This approach is good when you start to move applications out of your own on-premises environment. The management and operations are often similar to an on-premises environment, so IaaS provides a natural progression for the business, IT, and application owners to become comfortable with the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Platform as a Service (PaaS) &mdash;You purchase the underlying platform stack from a vendor that manages the OS and patches, and bring your applications and data. You don&rsquo;t worry about VMs or the virtual network, and your operations team can focus more of their time on application reliability and performance. This approach often starts making the IT organization and the business comfortable with running applications in the cloud. Your focus is on the applications and your customers, with fewer worries about the infrastructure needed to run those apps.</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Software as a Service (SaaS) &mdash;You just need access to software, with a vendor providing everything else. Developers can build against an existing platform to provide customizations or unique features without having to maintain a large code base.</p>
						<p>This approach is often daunting at first, but you likely already know about and use a successful SaaS offering such as Salesforce, Office 365, or the Google suite of Mail or Docs. You use email, create documents or presentations, or manage customer contact information and sales information. Your focus is on the content that you create and manage, not on how to make the application run.</p>
