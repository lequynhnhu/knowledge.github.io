          				<p> On-premises &mdash;You configure and manage the entire data center, such as the network cables, storage, and servers. You&rsquo;re responsible for all parts of the application environment, support, and redundancy. This approach provides maximum control, but with a lot of management overhead.</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) &mdash;You purchase the base compute resources from a vendor that manages the core infrastructure. You create and manage the VMs, data, and applications. The cloud provider is responsible for the physical infrastructure, host management, and resiliency. You may still have an infrastructure team to help support and deploy VMs, but the team is free from the time and cost of managing the physical equipment.</p>
						<p>This approach is good when you start to move applications out of your own on-premises environment. The management and operations are often similar to an on-premises environment, so IaaS provides a natural progression for the business, IT, and application owners to become comfortable with the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Platform as a Service (PaaS) &mdash;You purchase the underlying platform stack from a vendor that manages the OS and patches, and bring your applications and data. You don&rsquo;t worry about VMs or the virtual network, and your operations team can focus more of their time on application reliability and performance. This approach often starts making the IT organization and the business comfortable with running applications in the cloud. Your focus is on the applications and your customers, with fewer worries about the infrastructure needed to run those apps.</p>
						<br/>
						<p> Software as a Service (SaaS) &mdash;You just need access to software, with a vendor providing everything else. Developers can build against an existing platform to provide customizations or unique features without having to maintain a large code base.</p>
						<p>This approach is often daunting at first, but you likely already know about and use a successful SaaS offering such as Salesforce, Office 365, or the Google suite of Mail or Docs. You use email, create documents or presentations, or manage customer contact information and sales information. Your focus is on the content that you create and manage, not on how to make the application run.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Most of what you create in Azure falls into the IaaS and PaaS areas. The main use cases include VMs and virtual networking (IaaS) or the Azure Web Apps, Functions, and Cosmos DB (PaaS) services. If you&rsquo;re a developer, the PaaS solutions are probably the areas you&rsquo;re most interested in, because Microsoft covers the infrastructure parts to let you focus on your code. IT pros may lean more toward the IaaS solutions to build out and control the Azure infrastructure.</p>
						<br/>
					<h5>Virtualization in Azure</h5>
						<br/>
							<p>Virtualization logically divides physical resources in a server into virtual resources that can be securely accessed by individual workloads. A VM is one of the most common resources in cloud computing. A VM contains a virtual CPU (vCPU), memory (vRAM), storage (vDisk), and network connectivity (vNIC).</p>
							<br/>
							<p>In addition to physical servers, storage and networking are commonly virtualized, which allows the Azure platform to quickly define everything you need in software. No physical interaction or manual configuration of devices is required. You don&rsquo;t have to wait for another team to provide an IP address, open a network port, or add storage for you.</p>
