				</div>
				<div class="market-status-table mt-4">
					<p>The monolithic architecture approach is considered a classic and assumes that all components of one program are implemented on a single code base. This is a full-fledged module that works autonomously and independently of other applications.</p>
					</br/>
					<p>With this approach, all components of the program are interconnected and interchangeable - this helps to develop the program as self-sufficient. At the same time, removing one element inevitably causes changes throughout the system.</p>
					</br/>
					<p>As you add new features and changes to the same code base, it will grow over time. This approach is well suited for small development teams and has the corresponding benefits. A monolith usually has a server application, a user interface, and a single database. All functions are managed and serviced in one place, which is an advantage in some cases.</p>
