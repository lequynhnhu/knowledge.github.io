					<h5>OAuth 2.0 Actors</h5>
						<p>OAuth 2.0 introduces four actors in a typical OAuth flow.</p>
						</br>
							<p>1. <strong>Resource owner:</strong> One who owns the resources. In our example earlier, the third-party web application wants to access the Facebook wall of a Facebook user via the Facebook API and publish messages on behalf of him/her. In that case, the Facebook user who owns the Facebook wall is the resource owner.</p>
							<p>2. <strong>Resource server:</strong> This is the place which hosts protected resources. In the preceding scenario, the server that hosts the Facebook API is the resource server, where Facebook API is the resource.</p>
							<p>3. <strong>Client</strong>: This is the application which wants to access a resource on behalf of the resource owner. In the preceding use case, the thirdparty web application is the client.</p>
							<p>4. <strong>Authorization server:</strong> This is the entity which acts as a security token service to issue OAuth 2.0 access tokens to client applications. In the preceding use case, Facebook itself acts as the authorization server.</p>
