					<p>UMA is an OAuth 2.0 profile. OAuth 2.0 decouples the resource server from the authorization server. UMA takes one step further: it lets you control a distributed set of resource servers from a centralized authorization server. Also the resource owner can define a set of policies at the authorization server, which can be evaluated at the time a client is granted access to a protected resource. This eliminates the need of having the presence of the resource owner to approve access requests from arbitrary clients or requesting parties. The authorization server can make the decision based on the policies defined by the resource owner.</p>
