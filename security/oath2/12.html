							<h5>What is a bearer token?</h5>
							</br>
								<p>The OAuth specification defines a bearer token as a security device with the property that any party in possession of the token (a &ldquo;bearer&rdquo;) can use the token, regardless of who that party is. In this way, a bearer token is much like a bus token or a ticket to an amusement park ride: these items grant access to services, and don&rsquo;t care who uses them. As long as you&rsquo;ve got a bus token, you can ride the bus.</p>
								<p>From a technological standpoint, you can think about bearer tokens in much the same way as you do browser cookies. Both share some basic properties:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>They use plaintext strings.</li>
									<li>No secret or signature is involved.</li>
									<li>TLS is the basis of the security model.</li>
								</ul>
