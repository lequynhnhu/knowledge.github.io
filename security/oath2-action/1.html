                  				<p>OAuth 2.0 is a delegation protocol, a means of letting someone who controls a resource allow a software application to access that resource on their behalf with- out impersonating them. The application requests authorization from the owner of the resource and receives tokens that it can use to access the resource. This all happens without the application needing to impersonate the person who controls the resource, since the token explicitly represents a delegated right of access.</p>
                				</br>
                  				<p>In many ways, you can think of the OAuth token as a &ldquo;valet key&rdquo; for the web. Not all cars have a valet key, but for those that do, the valet key provides additional security beyond simply handing over the regular key. The valet key of a car allows the owner of the car to give limited access to someone, the valet, without handing over full control in the form of the owner&rsquo;s key.</p>
                   				</br>
                  				<p>Simple valet keys limit the valet to accessing the ignition and doors but not the trunk or glove box. More complex valet keys can limit the upper speed of the car and even shut the car off if it travels more than a set distance from its starting point, sending an alert to the owner. In much the same way, OAuth tokens can limit the client&rsquo;s access to only the actions that the resource owner has delegated</p>
                			</br>
                    			<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have a cloud photo-storage service and a photo- printing service, and you want to be able to print the photos that you have stored in your storage service. Luckily, your cloud-printing service can communicate with your cloud-storage service using an API. This is great, except that the two services are run by different companies, which means that your account with the storage service has no connection to your account with the printing service. We can use OAuth to solve this problem by letting you delegate access to your photos across the different services, all without giving your password away to the photo printer.</p>
                			</br>
								Although OAuth is largely indifferent to what kind of resource it is protecting, it does fit nicely with today’s RESTful web services, and it works well for both web and native client applications. It can be scaled from a small single-user application up to a multimillion-user internet API. It’s as much at home on the untamed wilds of the web, where it grew up and is used to protect user-facing APIs of all types, as it is inside the controlled and monitored boundaries of an enterprise, where it’s being used to manage access to a new generation of internal business APIs and systems.
							</br>
								The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain lim- ited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
