                  <p>OAuth 2.0 is a delegation protocol, a means of letting someone who controls a resource allow a software application to access that resource on their behalf with- out impersonating them. The application requests authorization from the owner of the resource and receives tokens that it can use to access the resource. This all happens without the application needing to impersonate the person who controls the resource, since the token explicitly represents a delegated right of access.</p>
                </br>
                  <p>In many ways, you can think of the OAuth token as a &ldquo;valet key&rdquo; for the web. Not all cars have a valet key, but for those that do, the valet key provides additional security beyond simply handing over the regular key. The valet key of a car allows the owner of the car to give limited access to someone, the valet, without handing over full control in the form of the owner&rsquo;s key.</p>
                   </br>
                  <p>Simple valet keys limit the valet to accessing the ignition and doors but not the trunk or glove box. More complex valet keys can limit the upper speed of the car and even shut the car off if it travels more than a set distance from its starting point, sending an alert to the owner. In much the same way, OAuth tokens can limit the client&rsquo;s access to only the actions that the resource owner has delegated</p>
