							<p>When constructing a house, nobody would ever consider not buying materials and tools and hiring resources as the first steps of the building process. Yet, too often in the world of IT we see teams rush to the development phase without a clear vision of what the business and technical requirements are.</p>
							</br>
							<p>With cloud computing, the need for a pragmatic approach is even more critical because the risks are greater as more control is shifted to cloud service providers. Whether a company has an official enterprise architecture practice in place or not, success in the cloud is dependent on applying the basics of sound architectural principles and asking these six questions: Why, Who, What, Where, When, and How.</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>1. Why.</strong> What problem are we trying to solve? What are the business goals and drivers?<br /><strong>2. Who.</strong> Who needs this problem solved? Who are all the actors involved (internal/external)?</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>3. What.</strong> What are the business and technical requirements? What legal and/or regulatory constraints apply? What are the risks?<br /> Where. Where will these services be consumed? Are there any location-specific requirements (regulations, taxes, usability concerns, language/locale issues, etc.)?</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>4. When.</strong> When are these services needed? What is the budget? Are there dependencies on other projects/initiatives?</p>
							</br>
							<p>The final question to ask is often overlooked, even though it is one of the most important questions. This question focuses on the current state of the organization and its ability to adapt to the changes that cloud computing brings.</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>5. How.</strong> How can the organization deliver these services? What is the readiness of the organization, the architecture, the customer?</p>
							</br>
							<h5>Start with the Business Architecture</h5>
							</br>
								<p>A good first step when starting a major cloud initiative is to create a business architecture diagram. This is important because it provides insights into the various touchpoints and business functions across the enterprise or at least across the part of the enterprise that is in scope for the initiative.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Even though the first phase of the project may only focus on a single component of the architecture, it is important to understand how that component fits into the entire business architecture. Too often we build things with a limited view of the enterprise and wind up deploying solutions that are difficult to integrate within the enterprise.</p>
								</br>
								<p>It is like planning to install a door in the front entrance with a limited understanding of what the rest of the house looks like. Sure, we can successfully install the door within the doorframe, but what if the door opens out and we did not know that another worker was putting a screen door in front of the door? It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the screen door is getting installed now or a year from now; either way we would have to replace the original door to open in. The same applies to building cloud services. The architects should have some level of visibility into the overall vision of the enterprise before they start installing doors.</p>
