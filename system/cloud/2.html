							<p>When constructing a house, nobody would ever consider not buying materials and tools and hiring resources as the first steps of the building process. Yet, too often in the world of IT we see teams rush to the development phase without a clear vision of what the business and technical requirements are.</p>
							</br>
							<p>With cloud computing, the need for a pragmatic approach is even more critical because the risks are greater as more control is shifted to cloud service providers. Whether a company has an official enterprise architecture practice in place or not, success in the cloud is dependent on applying the basics of sound architectural principles and asking these six questions: Why, Who, What, Where, When, and How.</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>1. Why.</strong> What problem are we trying to solve? What are the business goals and drivers?<br /><strong>2. Who.</strong> Who needs this problem solved? Who are all the actors involved (internal/external)?</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>3. What.</strong> What are the business and technical requirements? What legal and/or regulatory constraints apply? What are the risks?<br /> Where. Where will these services be consumed? Are there any location-specific requirements (regulations, taxes, usability concerns, language/locale issues, etc.)?</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>4. When.</strong> When are these services needed? What is the budget? Are there dependencies on other projects/initiatives?</p>
							</br>
							<p>The final question to ask is often overlooked, even though it is one of the most important questions. This question focuses on the current state of the organization and its ability to adapt to the changes that cloud computing brings.</p>
							</br>
							<p><strong>5. How.</strong> How can the organization deliver these services? What is the readiness of the organization, the architecture, the customer?</p>
							</br>
							<h5>Start with the Business Architecture</h5>
							</br>
								<p>A good first step when starting a major cloud initiative is to create a business architecture diagram. This is important because it provides insights into the various touchpoints and business functions across the enterprise or at least across the part of the enterprise that is in scope for the initiative.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Even though the first phase of the project may only focus on a single component of the architecture, it is important to understand how that component fits into the entire business architecture. Too often we build things with a limited view of the enterprise and wind up deploying solutions that are difficult to integrate within the enterprise.</p>
								</br>
								<p>It is like planning to install a door in the front entrance with a limited understanding of what the rest of the house looks like. Sure, we can successfully install the door within the doorframe, but what if the door opens out and we did not know that another worker was putting a screen door in front of the door? It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the screen door is getting installed now or a year from now; either way we would have to replace the original door to open in. The same applies to building cloud services. The architects should have some level of visibility into the overall vision of the enterprise before they start installing doors.</p>
								</br>
							<h5>Identify the Problem Statement (Why)</h5>
							</br>
								<p>The question, &ldquo;What problem are we trying to solve?&rdquo; (the why) is the single most important question to answer. What are the business drivers for leveraging cloud computing services within an organization? The answer is different for every company, every culture, and every architecture.</p>
								</br>
								<p>For example, for start-ups, building new in the cloud is a no-brainer. In fact, if a start-up decides to build and manage its own infrastructure, it better have a very compelling reason for selecting physical infrastructure and data centers over cloud computing, because most venture capitalists (VC) and angel investors will question the management team&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
								</br>
								<p>On the other side of the equation are large established enterprises with huge amounts of physical infrastructure on the balance sheets and many different technology stacks and legacy architectures deployed in production environments. Figuring out how to best leverage cloud services is a much more complicated decision to make in enterprises.</p>
								</br>
								<p>If one of the business drivers is to &ldquo;reduce IT infrastructure costs,&rdquo; a start-up can easily achieve that goal by building its greenfield applications in the cloud without investing in data centers and infrastructure and all the people to manage them. An established enterprise will have to evaluate every single component of the existing enterprise separately to determine what can be moved to the cloud and which deployment model (public, private, hybrid) makes sense for each component.</p>
								</br>
								<p>A large organization may choose to reduce costs many different ways and leverage different service models. For example, it may be supporting numerous commercial software products to manage noncore competency business processes like payroll, human resources tasks, accounting, and so forth. The organization may decide to replace these solutions with Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.</p>
								</br>
								<p>At the same time it may not be as easy to migrate legacy applications to a PaaS or an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud provider because the underlying architecture does not support web-based or stateless architectures and the cost of rearchitecting makes it unfeasible. Instead, the organization may choose to leverage the cloud for specific purposes like backup and recovery, provisioning testing and development environments on demand, or integrating with an external API&nbsp; for a specific set of data (maps, Zip code lookups, credit check, etc.).</p>
								</br>
								<p>Every piece of the overall architecture should be evaluated independently to ensure that the optimal cloud service and deployment models are selected. With the exception of greenfield start-ups, rarely does it make sense to select one cloud service model and one deployment model. Use a hammer when you have nails and a screwdriver when you have screws.</p>
								</br>
							<h5>Evaluate User Characteristics (Who)</h5>
							</br>
								<p>The who question identifies the users of the system, both internal and external. Users may be people or systems. Identifying the actors helps discover what organizations (internal and external) interact with the overall system. Each actor within a system may have its own unique needs. It is possible that one cloud service model does not meet the needs of every actor.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Once the actors are identified, it is important to understand the characteristics of these actors, such as demographics (age group, how tech savvy they are, what countries they are in, etc.), type of actor (person, business, government, etc.), type of business (social media, health, manufacturing, etc.), and so forth.</p>
								</br>
								<p>The who question uncovers numerous functional and nonfuntional requirements. In the case of cloud computing, actor characteristics drive important design considerations in the areas of privacy, regulations, usability, risk, and more.</p>
								</br>
							<h5>Identify Business and Technical Requirements (What)</h5>
							</br>
								<p>The what question drives the discovery of many functional and nonfunctional requirements. Functional requirements describe how the system, application, or service should function.</p>
								</br>
									<ul>
										<li><p>What data the system must process.</p></li>
										<li><p>How the screens should operate.</p></li>
										<li><p>How the workflow operates.</p></li>
										<li><p>What the outputs of the system are.</p></li>
										<li><p>Who has access to each part of the system.</p></li>
										<li><p>What regulations must be adhered to.</p></li>
									</ul>
								</br>
								<p>Nonfunctional requirements describe how the architecture functions. The following list contains the categories of nonfunctional requirements that should be evaluated to assist in selecting the appropriate cloud service and deployment models:</p>
								</br>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Usability</strong>. Requirements for end users and systems that use the platform.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Performance</strong>. Ability to respond to user and system requests.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Flexibility</strong>.Ability tochangeatthespeedofbusiness with minimal code changes.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Capability</strong>. Ability to perform business functions both current and future.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Security</strong>. Requirements around security, privacy, and compliance.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Traceability</strong>. Requirements around logging, auditing, notifications, and event processing.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Reusability</strong>. Level of reuse required both internally and externally.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Integrability</strong>. Ability to integrate with various systems and technologies.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Standardization</strong>. Specific industry standards to comply with.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Scalability</strong>. Ability to scale to meet demands of the business.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Portability</strong>. Capability to deploy on various hardware and software platforms.</p>
								<p>&bull; <strong>Reliability</strong>. Required uptime and SLAs, along with recovery mechanisms.</p>
								/br>
							<h5>Visualize the Service Consumer Experience (Where)</h5>
							</br>
								<p>A good building architect would never build a plan for a house if he had no idea where the house was going to be located, how big the lot is, what the zoning restrictions are, what the climate is like, and all of those constraints that come with the location of the building.</p>
								</br>
								<p>For example, in Florida, much of the architecture of a house focuses on withstanding high winds during hurricane season and extreme heat during the summer. The architecture for a new house in Toronto will likely avoid the design costs associated with withstanding hurricane-force winds but instead focus more on holding up to cold temperatures and distributing heat evenly throughout the structure.</p>
								</br>
								<p>With cloud computing, it is critical to understand the impact of laws as they relate to the locale where the cloud services are being consumed and where the data is being stored. Laws and regulations have different constraints across countries, provinces, states, and even counties.</p>
								</br>
								<p>For example, in the couponing industry, marketing campaigns focusing on tobacco, alcohol, and even dairy must comply with laws against promoting these categories within certain counties.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Architects need to become familiar with the laws and regulations that pertain to their business and their data. The impact of these laws can influence decisions like public versus private cloud, cloud versus noncloud, and local vendor versus international vendor.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Often, hybrid cloud solutions are used to address these concerns. Companies often leverage public IaaS or PaaS service models for the majority of their processing needs and keep the data they do not want subject to seizure under laws like the Patriot Act in a private cloud or in an in-house noncloud data center.</p>
								</br>
								<p>A more exciting where question is: What devices and touchpoints are these cloud services being accessed by? Today&rsquo;s users consume data through channels on many touchpoints. We consume information on the web, on mobile devices and tablets, with scanners, and with medical devices, to name a few.</p>
								</br>
								<p>Even our cars, refrigerators, home security systems, and almost anything with an IP address can interact with end users in this day and age. Knowing up front what all of these touchpoints are can drive some important decisions.</p>
